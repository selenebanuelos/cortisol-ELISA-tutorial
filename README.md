## Overview
cortisol-ELISA-tutorial.qmd was created as a guided tutorial to check the quality of ELISA data and fit standard curve models.

## Motivation
This tutorial was designed for a user that developed an ELISA assay to measure cortisol in hair, who had minimal experience using R but was interested in learning. I decided to provide the script in the form of a quarto document for ease of including formatted commentary and use of R code for the user.

## Usage
The script was designed to be used in the context of an Rproject and includes some resources on how to do so and the benefits.
